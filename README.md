# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this project is to use Python to write algorithms that assist in the confirmation and analysis of election results.
In this analysis, we calculated the number of total votes, the number of votes, and percentage by county and by candidate, and presented the largest county turnover and the winner.
The result was written to a text file, which will be sent to the election commission.
